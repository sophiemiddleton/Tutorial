## Introduction

This set of tutorial exercises will show you how to use the various programs and utilities that are suppored by the Analysis Tools group.

By the end of these exercises, you will be able to:

* access the [Elastic Analysis Facility (EAF)](,
* process [EventNtuple](https://github.com/Mu2e/EventNtuple) files in either ROOT or python,
* perform the Reference Analysis on a Mock Dataset, and
* visualize Mu2e events with the Mu2e Event Display

## Exercises

1. Logging into the Elastic Analysis Facility (EAF)
2. Setting up the environment on the Elastic Analysis Facility
3. Getting a list of EventNtuple files
4. [Taking a direct look at the EventNtuple](./eventntuple-basics.md)
5. Analyzing the EventNtuple with [ROOT](./eventntuple-rooutil.md) or [Python](./eventntuple-pyutil.md)
6. Looking at an interesting event with the Mu2e Event Display
7. Performing the Reference Analysis

## Optional Exercises
1. Creating your own EventNtuple dataset
