# Taking a direct look at the EventNtuple (Draft)

## Introduction

Now that we have a list of EventNtuple files, let's take a look at one directly to understand the structure of the EventNtuple.

The EventNtuple is a [ROOT TTree](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTTree.html). You can think of it like a giant spreadsheet: each row is a Mu2e event and each leaf is a column.

The actual structure is a bit more complicated. We collect leaves that related to the same underlying object into branches. For example, all leaves related to the reconstructed track are on the ```trk``` branch. Also, leaves and branches might not be a single number like in a spreadsheet, but an array of numbers (or even an array of arrays of numbers). For example, the ```trk``` branch is an array because there can be more than one track in an event.

In this tutorial, we will access the EventNtuple directly and learn how to find out more information about its branches and leaves. Note that in your real analysis, you are unlikely to access the EventNtuple directly but through utilities such as [RooUtil]() and [PyUtil](), which will be taught in the next tutorial.

## What is mock data?

For this tutorial we will utilize "mock data." Details about our current mock data efforts can be found at: [Mock Data] (https://mu2ewiki.fnal.gov/wiki/Mock_Data_(MDS)).

Mock data is simulated "data". It consists of reconstructed monte carlo with all backgrounds and signal samples combined and weighted to represent a given set of beam conditions (booster batch mode, livetime, signal rate etc.).

Mock data is useful in helping us develop our analysis infrastructure and  therefore we base our tutorial around it.

## Accessing the EventNtuple

Because the EventNtuple is a [ROOT TTree](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTTree.html), it can be accessed in either ROOT or python like any other TTree.

To print the branches and leaves of the EventNtuple:

* in ROOT:

```
root -l nts.mu2e.....root
EventNtuple->cd()
ntuple->Print()
```

* in python:

```
import uproot
ntuple = uproot.open(filename+":EventNtuple/ntuple")
...
```

As you can see, there are a lot of branches. But what do they _mean_? Pick a branch that you want to understand more about and continue to the next section

## Getting help with ```ntuplehelper```

We will use the [```ntuplehelper```](https://github.com/Mu2e/EventNtuple/blob/main/doc/ntuplehelper.md) to find out more about your branch.

The ```ntuplehelper``` is a command line tool that prints descriptions of branches and leaves. To understand more about the branch you selected, do the following replacing ```branch``` with the name of the branch you want to know more about.

* on the command line:

```
ntuplehelper branch.*
```

* in python
```
>>> import ntuplehelper
>>> nthelper = ntuplehelper.nthelper()
>>> nthelper.whatis("branch.*")
```

As you can see, you get a brief description of the branch, as well as a description of every leaf on that branch.

(Note that you can also list all branches with ```ntuplehelper --list-all-branches``` or ```nthelper.list_all_branches()```. This complete list is also documented in the EventNtuple repository [here](https://github.com/Mu2e/EventNtuple/blob/main/doc/branches.md))

## The Structure of the EventNtuple

Each entry in the EventNtuple corresponds to a single Mu2e event.

You might have noticed when the list of all branches was printed was that some branches were described as "single-object" branches, some where described as "vector" objects, and the rest were described as "vector of vector" branches.

Single object branches describe a whole event.

Vector object branches.  For example the ```trk``` branch is a vector because a single event contains more than one track. Their structure will look something like:

```
[ trk1, trk2, ..., trkN ]
```

Vector-of-vector branches.

For example the ```trkhits``` branch is a vector-of-vectors because a single track contains more than one hit. Their structure will look something like:

```
[ [trk1_hit1, trk1_hit2, ..., trk1_hitM], [trk2_hit1, trk2_hit2, ..., trk2_hitN], ..., [trkN_hit1, trkN_hit2, ..., trkN_hitM] ]
```

## Conclusion
You can now:

* directly open the EventNtuple file in ROOT and/or python, and
* get information about branches in leaves with ```ntuplehelper```
