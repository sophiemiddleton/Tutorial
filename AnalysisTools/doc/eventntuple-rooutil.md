# Analyzing the EventNtuple with RooUtil (Draft)

## Introduction
In the [previous exercise](eventntuple-basics.md), we learned how to access the EventNtuple directly and get information about the branches and leaves contained in it. As mentioned, this has limited use for a real analysis.

In this exercise, we will use RooUtil to:

* plot information from the ntuple,
* make cuts on the ntuple,
* produce a reduced ntuple(?)

Quick reference information about RooUtil is in the EventNtuple repository [here](https://www.github.com/Mu2e/EventNtuple/utils/rooutil/README.md)

## The Simplest Example

## Plotting

## Cutting

## Analyzer-Friendly Classes: ```Tracks```, ```TrackSegments``` etc.

## Creating Ntuples?
